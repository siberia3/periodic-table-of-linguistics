# THE MENDELEEV PERIODIC TABLE OF LINGUISTICS

## WHAT IS IT

The **Mendeleev's Periodic Table of Linguistics** [(→ Author's Site here)](https://pagano-arte.blogspot.com/2021/02/the-mendeleevs-periodic-table-of.html) [(→ Github source file here)](https://github.com/siberia3/periodic-table-of-linguistics/blob/main/The-Mendeleev-Periodic-Table-of-Linguistics.html) is a specific chapter from the **Theory of the Siberian Canoe** [(→ Author's Site here)](https://pagano-arte.blogspot.com/2020/08/theory-of-siberian-canoe.html) [(→ Github source file here)](https://github.com/siberia3/periodic-table-of-linguistics/blob/main/Theory-of-the-Siberian-Canoe.html). 

The **Theory of the Siberian Canoe** was developed from the idea of the *Continuous Chain of Toponyms in the form KHANGA/SHAMBA* along the coasts of the Indian Ocean — an idea that results from an alternative analysis of the term *Lapp* (the scandinavian peoples **Saami**) through the method of the *Phonetic comparison*, which the author extended on an global scale.  

This process took to dive into the Indo-Pacific Coastal Migrations and, in particular, to the new hypothesis of some coastal groups entering Siberia from the Pacific Ocean, *reaching Europe through the alluvial swamps of Siberia during the Ice Ages* — an hypothesis which seems a better explanation for a quantity of myths legends and mysteries.

## THE ENVIRONMENTAL ETHNIC PHONEMES

In the most recent version of the *Theory*, the author took on a more systematic work of linguistic comparison, creating tables for the main words describing **Basic Environments** (Sea, Coast, Forest, River, etc..) in as many languages as possible. This process of Abstraction was meant better to justify the *Basic Environmental Phonemes* of the previous versions, which described the basic **Ethnic Groups**: 

- "**WAKA**" (**KHAM'MBAHA** and variants) : Nomadic Coastal Peoples 
- "**BURU**" (**KHUM'MBURU** and variants) : Forest and Mountain Peoples
- "**ANGA**" (**KHAN'NGARA** and variants) : "*Hunting along the River Valley*" 

Briefly said, these phonemes talk about shy Human groups moving along the safer *Coastal Environment* and, in the search for *Fresh Water*, tracing back *Rivers*. This made them getting confident with *Dark Forests* and learning to manipulate *Hard Materials*, which will be the base for *Structures made of Stone*. 

The Nomadic Coastal Peoples then helped to spread *New Technologies* along the Coasts of the Indian and Pacific Ocean, and this habit to *Exploration and Commerce* will be the magic connection between a city like **_Jericho_** and the *Maya pyramids* through the hypothesis of the *Sailors of the Siberian Alluvial Swamps* during the Ice Ages. 


## THE PERIODIC TABLE OF LINGUISTICS

However — which was the starting issue of the name *Lapp* — the Peoples' Names as we know them, come from very different sources, nor the words of your language surely belong to your linguistic group since ever. 

As a result, the *Environmental Linguistic Tables* may show that the word *Sea* is mostly represented by a phoneme such as "WAKA", but don't prove that a people called "WAKA" necessarily developed as a *Coastal People*.

The author therefore realized that single languages still hold an intimate **Phonetic Consistency** based on those Basic Concepts, as they use the same Phoneme for all of them. This *Phonetic Consistency* is such, that one term might help *forecast* the shape of the others, giving this linguistic analytical system the name of **The Mendeleev's Periodic Table of Linguistics**.

* **Man**
* **Water**
* **River**
* **Forest**
* **Building**

In fact, since Objects and Environments likely took on their name according to the *Satisfaction of a Need*, this means that the archaic structures of that language developed in a certain environment — on the *Bright Coasts* (phonemes **WAH**) rather than in the *Dark Forests* (phonemes **WUH**) — which is more authentic a hints for its *Environmental Specialization*. 

This should make it possible to track movements and dependencies within Ancient Peoples — an idea the author represented as **Ranking of Linguistic Darkness**.


## WHAT YOU CAN DO

There are a lot of things that could be done for the *Theory of the Siberian Canoe* — such as filling the environmental tables, creating a database with filters, creating a statistical data visualization, etc... — but for the above explained reasons, the **Periodic Table** is the real thing to point to.

- the provided examples show that this system is so "true", that if the term is too much different from the fonetic sequence set up by "<i>Man</i>", you can "be sure" that you will find anyway a matching synonym. 

This is why the contribution of native speakers is much better situation than authors enjoying their own genius alone.

### KHANGA and WAGHA — The essence of Ainu's and north-Germanics

For example, the Table allows us to imagine the *Ainu's* as a "*People of the Littoral*", hunting on rivers upstream (**KHANGA**) but not going deep into the woods, and not building in stone.

On the contrary, German language does not use **GURU**-based fundamental dictionary as you might expect, but **WANDA**-based. Surprisingly? Not really, because North-Germanic tribes are known to be "*Coastal Nomads*", and their original name must have been similar to "**Vandal**" or to "**Viking**" (see **Winnili** "*Longobards*"), or also to "**Angles**" and to "**Danes**" (variant **KHANGA**).
