## WHAT IS IT

The **Mendeleev's Periodic Table of Linguistics** [(Author's Site here)](https://pagano-arte.blogspot.com/2021/02/the-mendeleevs-periodic-table-of.html) [(Github source file here)](https://github.com/siberia3/periodic-table-of-linguistics/blob/main/The-Mendeleev-Periodic-Table-of-Linguistics.html) is a specific chapter from the **Theory of the Siberian Canoe** [(Author's Site here)](https://pagano-arte.blogspot.com/2020/08/theory-of-siberian-canoe.html) [(Github source file here)](https://github.com/siberia3/periodic-table-of-linguistics/blob/main/Theory-of-the-Siberian-Canoe.html). 

The **Theory of the Siberian Canoe** was developed from the idea of the *Continuous Chain of Toponyms in the form KHANGA/SHAMBA* along the coasts of the Indian Ocean — an idea that results from an alternative analysis of the term *Lapp* (the scandinavian peoples **Saami**) through the method of the *Phonetic comparison*, which the author extended on an global scale.  

This process took to dive into the Indo-Pacific Coastal Migrations and, in particular, to the new hypothesis of some coastal groups entering Siberia from the Pacific Ocean, *reaching Europe through the alluvial swamps of Siberia during the Ice Ages* — an hypothesis which seems a better explanation for a quantity of myths legends and mysteries.

## THE ENVIRONMENTAL ETHNIC PHONEMES

In the most recent version of the *Theory*, the author took on a more systematic work of linguistic comparison, creating tables for the main words describing **Basic Environments** (Sea, Coast, Forest, River, etc..) in as many languages as possible. This process of Abstraction was meant better to justify the *Basic Environmental Phonemes* of the previous versions, which described the basic **Ethnic Groups**: 

- **KHAMBA** (and variants) : Nomadic Coastal Peoples 
- **MBURU** (and variants) : Forest and Mountain Peoples
- **KHANGA** (and variants) : "*Hunting along the River Valley*" 

Briefly said, these phonemes talk about shy Human groups moving along the safer *Coastal Environment* and, in the search for *Fresh Water*, tracing back *Rivers*. This made them getting confident with *Dark Forests* and learning to manipulate *Hard Materials*, which will be the base for *Structures made of Stone*. 

The Nomadic Coastal Peoples then helped to spread *New Technologies* along the Coasts of the Indian and Pacific Ocean, and this habit to *Exploration and Commerce* will be the magic connection between a city like **_Jericho_** and the *Maya pyramids* through the hypothesis of the *Sailors of the Siberian Alluvial Swamps* during the Ice Ages. 


## THE PERIODIC TABLE OF LINGUISTICS

However — which was the starting issue of the name *Lapp* — the Peoples' Names as we know them, come from very different sources, nor the words of your language surely belong to your linguistic group since ever. 

As a result, the *Environmental Linguistic Tables* may show that the word *Sea* is mostly represented by a phoneme such as "WAKA", but don't prove that a people called "WAKA" necessarily developed as a *Coastal People*.

The author therefore realized that single languages still hold an intimate **Phonetic Consistency** based on those Basic Concepts, as they use the same Phoneme for all of them. This *Phonetic Consistency* is such, that one term might help *forecast* the shape of the others, giving this linguistic analytical system the name of **The Mendeleev's Periodic Table of Linguistics**.

* **Man**
* **Water**
* **River**
* **Forest**
* **Building**

In fact, since Objects and Environments likely took on their name according to the *Satisfaction of a Need*, this means that the archaic structures of that language developed in a certain environment — on the *Bright Coasts* (phonemes **WAH**) rather than in the *Dark Forests* (phonemes **WUH**) — which is more authentic a hints for its *Environmental Specialization*. 

This should make it possible to track movements and dependencies within Ancient Peoples — an idea the author represented as **Ranking of Linguistic Darkness**.


## WHAT YOU CAN DO

There are a lot of things that could be done for the *Theory of the Siberian Canoe* — such as filling the environmental tables, creating a database with filters, creating a statistical data visualization, etc... — but for the above explained reasons, the **Periodic Table** is the real thing to point to.

The given examples show that this system is so "true" that, if one word appears very different from the others, you can "be sure" that you will find a related synonym that matches the phonetic sequence. 

This is why the contribution of native speakers is much better situation than authors enjoying their own genius alone.
